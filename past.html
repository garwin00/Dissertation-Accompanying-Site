    <h2>The erosion of online privacy</h2>

    <h3 id="top">2. The Past</h3>
    <blockquote>“You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it”</blockquote>
    <cite>- Scott McNealy, Sun Microsystems CEO, 1999</cite>
    <p>It could be argued that online privacy was never at the forefront of most consumer minds, as it is only recently that high profile data leaks have brought these security concerns to light. With companies like Facebook and Google collecting and storing user data on an unprecedented scale when did it become commonplace that anyone could have unfettered access to our data with no repercussions? Is it just for the sake of convenience or have we been conditioned to accept it? </p>
    <p>Modern privacy concerns can be traced back to two seminal events:</p>
    <p>In 1995 Harvard Graduate Daniel Jaye was running the back-end databases at Fidelity Investments, a financial planning and retirement corporation. Jaye had become intrigued by the power that a connected world, still in its infancy at this stage, could have when identifying potential buyers. He theorised that small text files named cookies, previously only used to hold log-in information, could be used to identify users of a certain website and track their browsing patterns. Cookies were anonymous, opting for a unique cookie ID number instead of personally identifiable information, and even though this was an improvement over traditional, direct marketing it didn’t last.</p>
    <p>One thing that did though - this was the birth of the tracking cookie. </p>
    <p>The years that followed saw the internet booming, and while advertisers at the time were not explicitly interested in specific advertisement targeting, online tracking exploded in both its effectiveness and popularity. During this time of exponential growth, Silicon Valley had exploded alongside it, companies at the centre of this bubble discovered that selling software was only profitable for the outliers and many were beginning to flounder.</p>
    <p>In 2000, a class-action lawsuit was brought against the online advertising company DoubleClick, alleging that their tracking cookies had violated, among other things, laws against electronic surveillance. The courts found that this was not the case, and decided that users had given adequate permission to the storage of tracking cookies by simply continuing to use the services. This was a seminal moment as now that tracking had been given the green light by the courts, Silicon Valley had found its business model.</p>
    <p>This led to the birth of a new industry, data tracking. </p>
    <p>As a result of this landmark decision companies were born with the express purpose of recording web users’ every click online. By 2007, all top corporations had joined in the act of advertising tracking, with Google itself paying $3.1bn for DoubleClick and Microsoft paying a record $6bn for another ad company called aQuantive. <sup><a href="bibliography.html#five" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[5]</a></sup> These sales proved to the rest of the industry that tracking was a lucrative business to be taken advantage of.</p>
    <p>The next foundational event was something that would forever alter the way humanity was surveilled, and it is something that we are still feeling the repercussions of today: </p>
    <p>September 11th, 2001 - The rise of ubiquitous surveillance. </p>
    <p>In the days immediately following the attacks, the United States government passed sweeping new acts to surveil the mass populace, the likes of which hadn’t been seen since the “COINTELPRO” program run by the FBI between 1956 - 1971 to surveil domestic threats. </p>
    <p>Surveillance itself isn’t inherently a bad thing. Parents surveil their children to make sure they are safe online, and there’s a need for law enforcement to surveil those who are likely to commit crime. It is only when surveillance - or “<em>systematic observation</em>” as it has been coined - becomes obtrusive and overbearing that it can become a problem. </p>
    <p>According to a leaked document - the NSA began their surveillance programs on the 14th of September, three days after the attacks. The surveillance performed here was so widespread and so intrusive that one NSA analyst, Bill Binney, described the volume of data collected as “<em>orders of magnitude more than the world’s most repressive secret police regimes, the Gestapo, the Stasi, and the KGB.</em>” <sup><a href="bibliography.html#six" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[6]</a></sup> What’s worse is that due to the surveillance acts passed as part of the reaction to the terror attacks, these surveillance methods were warrant-less, intrusive and most worrying - completely legal.</p>
    <p>The actions of the United States government in the days after the attacks laid the groundwork for mass surveillance to become the all-permeating and Orwellian beast that we know today. Governments around the world learned that not only will citizenry accept this state of affairs, they will do nothing to resist it. These “temporary” measures were only meant to last for 30 days, but were repeatedly extended, eventually becoming known as the “Patriot Act” in 2002, and they’re still in use today. <sup><a href="bibliography.html#seven" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[7]</a></sup></p>
    <p>What would happen if the majority of users knew about this program? How would they adjust their behaviour if they knew they were always being watched?</p>
    <p>In 2011 Finnish researchers carried out a year long study in ubiquitous surveillance. Volunteers had cameras set up in each room of their home (except for their bathrooms and bedrooms) and their TV, Computer and Phone usage were closely monitored. </p>
    <p>The study found that participants would alter their behaviours in order to protect their privacy; no longer inviting people into their homes, changing media habits, and choosing to have private conversations in areas not covered by microphones, or in public spaces. The lead researcher found that people’s privacy concerns plateaued after about three months, but that any small change or unpredicted event would lead them to develop new practises to maintain their privacy. </p>
    <p>Those who participated noted that even though they knew they could opt out at any time, constant surveillance was a source of “<em>annoyance, concern, anxiety and even rage</em>” <sup><a href="bibliography.html#eight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[8]</a></sup></p>
    <p>How would this translate to the populace as a whole? People have become complacent with the fact that they’re constantly surveilled and tracked, but what is actually happening behind the scenes? </p>
