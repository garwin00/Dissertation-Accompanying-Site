      <p><strong>Research Question:</strong></p>
      <p><em>How has the growth of the internet contributed to the erosion of online privacy?</em></p>
    </div>-->
    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <blockquote>“In a world where nearly everything is being monitored, it is easy to feel hopeless about privacy. Often, when I tell people I have just met that I write about privacy, their immediate response is, “I’ve given up. Privacy is dead.”</blockquote>
    <cite>- Julia Angwin, Dragnet Nation, 2014</cite>
    <p>Online privacy is a nuanced but incredibly important topic, the right to privacy is a basic human right, but who decided that this right doesn’t exist online? The problem seems to stem from a connected world. Today, everyone has access to a smart device that is monitoring their every move and cataloguing their every action, but to what end? Just who is watching and what do they want? </p>
    <p>With high profile data leaks and privacy violations becoming commonplace it’s becoming evident that not only is our data becoming a commodity, it’s an incredibly lucrative one. User data has become more valuable than oil, and large companies are competing to get as much of it as they can in order to turn their users into products. As Bruce Schneier, author of Data and Goliath, states “if something is free, you are not the customer, you are the product”. </em><sup><a href="bibliography.html#one" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a></sup></p>
    <p>Today, many users have become complacent at the state of online privacy. It’s often argued that if you’ve got nothing to hide, you’ve got nothing to fear. Schneier calls this <em>“the nothing to hide”</em> argument and adds that it is <em>“most common retort against privacy advocates.” </em> <sup> <a href="bibliography.html#two" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2]</a></sup> In the essay “I’ve Got Nothing to Hide” and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy” Daniel J. Solove attempts to dissect and counter this argument finding that those using this argument are unwilling to part with personal information when prompted for it in person, but claim to be fine giving it away online.</p>
    <p>It’s not just confined to the internet though, every move users make is being watched by multiple parties and vendors. Operating systems such as Microsoft’s Windows 10 routinely send telemetry data back to the company <sup><a href="bibliography.html#three" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[3]</a></sup> and Internet Service Providers keep detailed lists of every website visited under instructions from the UK Government. <sup><a href="bibliography.html#four" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[4]</a></sup></p>
    <p>In order to understand modern privacy concerns, one must first understand how things have ended up in this state. It’s important to look back and understand what led to the invasive practises that large companies and Governments use today, and also gain a fundamental understanding of the techniques and practices they are using to surveil them if they want to protect themselves. </p>
