    <p>With the world becoming increasing connected, privacy is becoming an after-thought. Invasive practises and surveillance are the new norm, and users have become complacent for the sake of convenience. When a user visits a website and is automatically logged in, that’s convenient, but it’s done through scripts that are also widely used to track them. They’re giving away their data at an alarming rate, and many do not even know that it is happening. This data is being harvested to turn users into a commodity. Something to be traded and sold to the highest bidder. It’s frankly disgusting. </p>
    <p>Huge technology companies watch each step we make online, logging and cataloguing it to be sold off to advertisers. Many have shown that that aren’t capable of safeguarding user data, and shouldn’t be trusted with it in the first place. Advertisers piece this data together with the aim of making money off of it, and in some worrying cases to manipulate users. There is evidence to suggest that Cambridge Analytica used user data to advertise political ads to certain Facebook profiles and demographics, potentially swaying the results of the US Presidential Election.</p>
    <p>Privacy violations aren’t just limited to companies either, governments and coalitions surveil entire countries under the guise of protection. This wouldn’t be necessarily a bad thing if they hadn’t proven time and time again that they will abuse and misuse this power. One need only post the wrong thing to social media in the United Kingdom to face potential jail time thanks to sweeping online government surveillance powers. <sup><a href="bibliography.html#twentyone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[21]</a></sup> </p>
    <p>More and more users are becoming concerned with their privacy, spurred on by constant barrages of advertisements and algorithms that show you what they think you want to see, instead of what you should be seeing. Organisations such as the EFF and search engines such as DuckDuckGo fight for the right to privacy because it’s a worthwhile is a cause to champion, just as much as climate change and other threats are. the populace as a whole need to push back and tell those committing these violations that it’s not okay.</p>
    <p>There are ways to fight back, there are ways for users to say that they are unhappy with the status quo, and there are ways to say that things are going to change. Privacy is almost a thing of the past. It’s only once we understand the full scale of the erosion that we can fight to repair it. </p>
